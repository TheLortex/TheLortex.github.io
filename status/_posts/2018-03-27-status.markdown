excerpt: This article holds my Github projects links related to Mirage-OCaml-ESP32 and will be updated with my progress. It also serve as my notepad and thought long-term storage so you might expect random stuff there too!

## Native backend

* OCaml 4.06.0 with xtensa target and custom settings to build the bytecode runtime on the ESP32. A lot of things are fairly hardcoded, so it's not practical. The whole toolchain can't be built right now, as it tries to built target binaries. The best way to have a functional cross-esp32 toolchain is to install the opam package from opam-cross-esp32.

* I have code generation and linking working.
* Now debugging it with a custom gdb and QEMU. 

## Cross-compilation of a Mirage unikernel

* Custom esp32 target in Mirage tool. 
  - [Github - mirage](https://github.com/TheLortex/mirage)
* OS bindings. 
  - [Github - mirage-esp32](https://github.com/TheLortex/mirage-esp32)
* opam-cross-esp32 working on the same scheme as opam-cross-android. It can be used to have a slightly functional OCaml cross-compiler to esp32 compatible with `ocamlfind -toolchain esp32` command. However don't expect to build unikernels with it *yet*. Now figuring out which libraries are strictly necessary, which one should be build with host tools, which one are jbuilder and which one are causing troubles.

## Documentation

I need to work on documenting everything I wrote before it becomes too much of a mess.
