Indeed given a grid it's possible to have multiple\nvalid solutions. Pierre Baqué's (my internship mentor) Multi-Modal\nMean-Field model should be able to cope with that kind of problems,\ncombined with traditional machine learning techniques.\n\nLearning the Sudoku rules as a set of constraints have been a success for\nthe 4x4 version but I faced combinatorial difficulties in the 9x9\n(traditional Sudoku) case, as inferring correct grids given a set of CRF\nconstraints was proven to be a hard problem.\n\n- [Github](//github.com/TheLortex/mean-field-inference) repository\n- Internship <a href={Report}>report</a>\n"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5e177616-863a-5c75-bdf0-fe63a6da4ddd","frontmatter__variant":"projects","frontmatter__slug":"mean-field","__params":{"frontmatter__variant":"projects","frontmatter__slug":"mean-field"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mean-field","date":"2017","location":"EPFL - CVLab, Lausanne, Switzerland","description":"Learning Sudoku rules with conditional random fields","hero_image":"./sudoku.jpg","hero_image_alt":"Sudoku","tags":["machine learning"],"slug":"mean-field","variant":"projects"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744905544"],"slicesMap":{}}
