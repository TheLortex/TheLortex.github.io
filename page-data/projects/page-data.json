One of the key goals of TheoremKB is to be able to compute the graph of theoretical results from a given research topic. In this graph, an edge is drawn from a result A to result B when B is used in the proof of A. Having a finer resolution than the citation graph, as nodes are individual results instead of whole documents, this graph should allow deducing interesting facts on scientific research, such as whether we can find proof cycles among papers (which would be possible as some authors cite not yet published content), or what results are impacted if a proof is found to be incorrect. The project aims at making bibliographical work easier by having a deeper understanding of how papers are related to each other. \n  </p>\n  <p>\n    I have developped a set of tools and libraries to perform <em>theorem extraction</em> using conditional random fields. While it doesn't beat state-of-the-art methods, the framework will allow building more complex algorithms performing information extraction in the TheoremKB project.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"//github.com/PierreSenellart/TheoremKB\">Github</a>\n      repository\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Internship\n      <a href=\"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02956526/document\">report </a> <em>(HAL: A Knowledge Base of Mathematical Results, Extracting scientific results from research articles)</em>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n"}}]},{"fieldValue":"2021","nodes":[{"childMdx":{"frontmatter":{"title":"OCaml documentation CI","description":"Using the ocurrent library, this CI is in charge of building the package documentation for the ocaml.org website","date":"2021","tags":["ocaml"],"inline":true,"slug":null,"hero_image_alt":null,"hero_image":null},"body":"- [Github project](https://github.com/ocurrent/ocaml-docs-ci)\n- [ICFP 2021 presentation: a multiverse of glorious documentation](https://watch.ocaml.org/w/keaLz7s91UVoqgmHn12a7a)\n"}},{"childMdx":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Physarum","description":"Conway game and pretty simulations using Rust and GPUs","date":"2021","tags":["what"],"inline":true,"slug":null,"hero_image_alt":"Slime simulation","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/eea3a55260372645d9843dfe46ccba7d/6dc66/physarum.png","srcSet":"/static/eea3a55260372645d9843dfe46ccba7d/76c0f/physarum.png 237w,\n/static/eea3a55260372645d9843dfe46ccba7d/cd5e6/physarum.png 474w,\n/static/eea3a55260372645d9843dfe46ccba7d/6dc66/physarum.png 947w","sizes":"(min-width: 947px) 947px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/eea3a55260372645d9843dfe46ccba7d/ced4a/physarum.webp 237w,\n/static/eea3a55260372645d9843dfe46ccba7d/4d2f3/physarum.webp 474w,\n/static/eea3a55260372645d9843dfe46ccba7d/1f5ca/physarum.webp 947w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 947px) 947px, 100vw"}]},"width":947,"height":931}}}},"body":"[Github](https://github.com/TheLortex/physarum)\n"}}]},{"fieldValue":"2022","nodes":[{"childMdx":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Amogu","description":"Incrustation of amongus characters in images, powered by the blazingly fast Rust programming language","date":"2022","tags":["what"],"inline":true,"slug":null,"hero_image_alt":null,"hero_image":null},"body":"[https://www.lortex.org/amogu/](https://www.lortex.org/amogu/)\n"}}]},{"fieldValue":"2023","nodes":[{"childMdx":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Forevr","description":"A collaborative social journal, safe space for all your memories","date":"2023","tags":["what"],"inline":true,"slug":null,"hero_image_alt":null,"hero_image":null},"body":"```\n.\n.\n.\n[REDACTED]\n```\n"}},{"childMdx":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Meio 🐈‍⬛","description":"A tool to monitor eio programs","date":"2023","tags":["systems","ocaml"],"inline":true,"slug":null,"hero_image_alt":null,"hero_image":null},"body":"[Github](https://github.com/tarides/meio)\n"}},{"childMdx":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Pixelstick","description":"A LED strip on a stick for light-painting photography","date":"2023","tags":["hardware","mobile"],"inline":true,"slug":null,"hero_image_alt":"A demonstration of the pixelstick","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9277227e5255594f3b71db5c3e352307/ee4c4/pixelstick.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9277227e5255594f3b71db5c3e352307/90089/pixelstick.jpg 360w,\n/static/9277227e5255594f3b71db5c3e352307/1ff76/pixelstick.jpg 720w,\n/static/9277227e5255594f3b71db5c3e352307/ee4c4/pixelstick.jpg 1440w","sizes":"(min-width: 1440px) 1440px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9277227e5255594f3b71db5c3e352307/27ab5/pixelstick.webp 360w,\n/static/9277227e5255594f3b71db5c3e352307/88c6b/pixelstick.webp 720w,\n/static/9277227e5255594f3b71db5c3e352307/8d77c/pixelstick.webp 1440w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1440px) 1440px, 100vw"}]},"width":1440,"height":1440}}}},"body":"[Github](https://github.com/TheLortex/batonpixel)\n"}}]}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744905544"],"slicesMap":{}}
