The internship lasted 5 months, from March to July 2018, and I worked under the supervision of [Anil Madhavapeddy](http://anil.recoil.org/). I presented my internship work on September 4, and I got a final mark of 18/20, confirming the validation of my first year of Master's degree in computer science !\n\nAs a recap, I achieved:\n\n- a working OCaml native compilation backend for Xtensa architecture.\n- an opam distribution containing cross-compilation package support for ESP32.\n- decent Mirage integration, including:\n  - operating system features: time, events and collaborative threading.\n  - network features: TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, HTTP, TLS.\n  - esp32 features: Wifi, LCD screen.\n  - mirage command line interface integration that allows easy builds.\n\nAll the information you might need to actually use this project is available on the [status](https://www.lortex.org/status/2018/10/02/status.html) page.\n\n## ICFP 2018 - OCaml Workshop talk\n\nimport Talk from \"./ESP32_talk.pdf\"\n\nMy talk was accepted for the OCaml Workshop co-located with ICFP 2018 in Saint-Louis, USA. \n- Informations on the talk are available on the ICFP 2018 website: [here](https://icfp18.sigplan.org/event/ocaml-2018-papers-ocaml-on-the-esp32-chip-well-typed-lightbulbs-await).\nA video will be available soon. \n- You can find the slides <a href={Talk}>here</a>.

However this is not the end of the project and there remains a lot to achieve. Things that I want to do include building new libraries to take advantage of ESP32 features and make them available trough Mirage abstractions.\n\nTODO:\n\n- Programming Ultra-Low Power processor\n- Reading sensors\n- Integrating sensors in the event system\n- Bluetooth integration\n- Reducing OCaml memory footprint\n- Benchmarking\n"}},"pageContext":{"id":"2371f6c6-e13d-5965-aefc-2e8503714fd7","frontmatter__variant":"articles","frontmatter__slug":"what-now","__params":{"frontmatter__variant":"articles","frontmatter__slug":"what-now"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What now?","slug":"what-now","date":"2018-10-02 10:00","category":"esp32","description":"My OCaml Labs internship is done, and my ESP32 work has been presented at ICFP 2018's OCaml Workshop.
