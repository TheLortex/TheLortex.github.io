    2019: Tarides fixed-term contract, under the supervision of Thomas
    Gazagnaire
  </em>
  <em>Late 2020: Back with Tarides to finish the work</em>
  <p>
    Following my Cambridge internship, I've been working for 5 months at
    <a href="//tarides.com">Tarides</a>, a startup company focusing on the OCaml
    ecosystem to build functional systems. The goal was to make the ESP32 port first
    class in the Mirage ecosystem, but it actually required deep build system changes.
    This work is not quite finished but most of the port to <a href="//dune.build">
      Dune
    </a> has been achieved.
