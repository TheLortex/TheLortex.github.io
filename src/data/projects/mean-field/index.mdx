Internship under the supervision of Pierre Baqué and Pascal Fua

Combining backpropagation with Mean-Field inference models: the goal was
to study these techniques in order to learn the rules of Sudoku as an
ill-posed problem. Indeed given a grid it's possible to have multiple
valid solutions. Pierre Baqué's (my internship mentor) Multi-Modal
Mean-Field model should be able to cope with that kind of problems,
combined with traditional machine learning techniques.

Learning the Sudoku rules as a set of constraints have been a success for
the 4x4 version but I faced combinatorial difficulties in the 9x9
(traditional Sudoku) case, as inferring correct grids given a set of CRF
constraints was proven to be a hard problem.
