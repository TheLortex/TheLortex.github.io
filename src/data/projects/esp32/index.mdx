  <h2>OCaml on ESP32: a tale of cross-compilation</h2>
  <em>
    2018: University of Cambridge - OCamlLabs internship, under the supervision
    of Anil Madhavapeddy
  </em>
  <p>
    During my Master's degree internship at
    <a href="//ocamllabs.io/">OCamlLabs</a> - Cambridge, I've been working on porting
    the <a href="//ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> compiler to the
    <a href="//www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview">ESP32</a>
    microcontroller. It's a low-budget, high-connectivity chipset which embeds a
    dual-core 240MHz processor along with Wifi and Bluetooth networking. It's an
    ideal platform for small connected devices that require low-cost, low-power but
    sufficient computing capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been able to add a new native compilation backend for the OCaml
    compiler, and successfully ported the base layer of
    <a href="//mirage.io">MirageOS</a>, along with the networking layer.
