## OCaml Labs internship overview

My research on OCaml/ESP32 devices was done as a research project in Cambridge Computer Laboratory's [OCaml Labs](http://ocamllabs.io/). The internship lasted 5 months, from March to July 2018, and I worked under the supervision of [Anil Madhavapeddy](http://anil.recoil.org/). I presented my internship work on September 4, and I got a final mark of 18/20, confirming the validation of my first year of Master's degree in computer science !

As a recap, I achieved:

- a working OCaml native compilation backend for Xtensa architecture.
- an opam distribution containing cross-compilation package support for ESP32.
- decent Mirage integration, including:
  - operating system features: time, events and collaborative threading.
  - network features: TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, HTTP, TLS.
  - esp32 features: Wifi, LCD screen.
  - mirage command line interface integration that allows easy builds.

All the information you might need to actually use this project is available on the [status](https://www.lortex.org/status/2018/10/02/status.html) page.

## ICFP 2018 - OCaml Workshop talk

import Talk from "./ESP32_talk.pdf"

My talk was accepted for the OCaml Workshop co-located with ICFP 2018 in Saint-Louis, USA. 
- Informations on the talk are available on the ICFP 2018 website: [here](https://icfp18.sigplan.org/event/ocaml-2018-papers-ocaml-on-the-esp32-chip-well-typed-lightbulbs-await).
A video will be available soon. 
- You can find the slides <a href={Talk}>here</a>. Finally, here are some pictures!

## What comes next ?

I'll pause my ESP32 work, to focus on other fields and courses for a semester. However this is not the end of the project and there remains a lot to achieve. Things that I want to do include building new libraries to take advantage of ESP32 features and make them available trough Mirage abstractions.

TODO:

- Programming Ultra-Low Power processor
- Reading sensors
- Integrating sensors in the event system
- Bluetooth integration
- Reducing OCaml memory footprint
- Benchmarking
