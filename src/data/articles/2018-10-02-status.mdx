* We now have native compilation for ESP32! That opens a lot of possibilities!
* Mirage is available for ESP32 target, it allows to build complex applications for this platform, such as an HTTPS server.
* All this work is stored under a Github organization: [well-typed-lightbulbs](https://github.com/well-typed-lightbulbs).

## Native backend

* OCaml 4.06.0 with xtensa target and custom settings to build the bytecode runtime on the ESP32. The best way to have a functional cross-esp32 toolchain is to install the `ocaml-esp32` opam package from opam-cross-esp32. It requires an `4.06.0+32bit` base compiler.

* I have code generation and linking working. This is an example with the files I used to build my native hello world!

## Cross-compilation of a Mirage unikernel

* See [Build your own Mirage](https://www.lortex.org/posts/mirage/esp32/2018/06/22/build-your-own-mirage.html) article to find out more about building a Mirage unikernel.

## Mirage unikernel samples

* Three sample docker scripts that build for ESP32: [esp32-docker-samples](https://github.com/well-typed-lightbulbs/esp32-docker-samples). They build C, OCaml and Mirage code.
* Three sample Mirage applications: [mirage-esp32-samples](https://github.com/well-typed-lightbulbs/mirage-esp32-samples). `hello_world`: a basic printer. `ap_dhcp`: an access point delivering IPs trough DHCP. `lcd_wifi_demo`: makes use of network and lcd screen features.
