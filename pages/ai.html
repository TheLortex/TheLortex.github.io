    <h2>Learning Sudoku rules with conditional random fields</h2>

      Combining backpropagation with Mean-Field inference models: the goal was
      to study these techniques in order to learn the rules of Sudoku as an
      ill-posed problem. Indeed given a grid it's possible to have multiple
      valid solutions. Pierre Baqué's (my internship mentor) Multi-Modal
      Mean-Field model should be able to cope with that kind of problems,
      combined with traditional machine learning techniques.

      Learning the Sudoku rules as a set of constraints have been a success for
      the 4x4 version but I faced combinatorial difficulties in the 9x9
      (traditional Sudoku) case, as inferring correct grids given a set of CRF
      constraints was proven to be a hard problem.
